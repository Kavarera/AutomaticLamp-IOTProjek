# IoT Project - Automatic Light Control

This project is part of my university coursework in the field of Internet of Things (IoT). The assigned project involves the implementation of an automatic light control system. The smart light is connected to a hosted database and can be managed through an Android application. The project encompasses various features, including turning the light on and off, toggling sensor status, scheduling automatic on/off times, and displaying a log history.

## Features

- Turn the light on and off remotely.
- Toggle sensor status for automated functionality.
- Schedule specific times for the light to automatically turn on/off.
- View a detailed history log of activities.

## Technologies Used

- Firebase: Cloud-based database for real-time data synchronization.
- Kotlin: Programming language for Android app development.
- Android: Platform for building mobile applications.
- NodeMCU ESP8266: Microcontroller for IoT devices.
- PIR Sensor: Passive Infrared Sensor for motion detection.
- LCD I2C 16x2: Liquid Crystal Display for visual output.
